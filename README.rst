NSiege
======

NSiege is a simple benchmarking framework created because there are `few alternatives <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9657601/simple-benchmarking-framework-for-c>`_ and `NTime <http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7008/NTime-Performance-unit-testing-tool>`_ was not what I was looking for - I want full control over benchmarking settings and results, which I am trying to provide with this project. I called it NSiege in honor of the great HTTP(S) benchmarking tool `Siege <http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/>`_, and because I also want to provide a `user simulation mode <http://linux.die.net/man/1/siege>`_ that introduces a certain delay between test executions instead of testing the maximum load.

Future work might include test attributes and a GUI as provided by NTime. Other suggestions more than welcome!
